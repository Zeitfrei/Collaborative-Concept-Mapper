Collaborative Concept Mapper is a plugin for the Moodle platform which allows students to create and edit concept maps through synchronous or asynchronous collaboration.
The plugin is based on an existing concept mapping tool developed by the Go-Lab Project. TogetherJS is used for session management and communication between clients.

This project was developed as part of my bachelor thesis.
